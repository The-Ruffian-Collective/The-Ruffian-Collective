### The Ruffian Collective ðŸ‘‹

Former high-end chef turned tech innovator. 25 years of running intense kitchens taught me how to build efficient systems, manage chaos, and deliver results under pressure. Now I'm applying that expertise to create AI-powered solutions for real-world problems.

#### What I'm About
- Building practical AI tools that solve actual business problems
- Converting 25+ years of hospitality experience into innovative tech solutions
- Making complex systems simple and efficient

#### Current Focus
```javascript
const currentProjects = {
    main: "AI-powered hospitality management solutions",
    tech: ["AI/ML", "SaaS Development", "Process Automation"],
    approach: "Build fast, test early, iterate often"
}
```

#### Tech Arsenal
- AI/ML Integration
- Full-Stack Development
- SaaS Architecture
- No-Code/Low-Code Solutions

#### Collaboration
I'm interested in projects that:
- Challenge conventional thinking
- Solve real operational problems
- Need a fresh perspective from someone who's run actual businesses

#### Background
```python
def experience():
    return {
        "hospitality": "Head Chef â†’ Restaurant Owner â†’ Multi-Brand Operator",
        "business": "Built and ran 3 successful companies",
        "tech": "Self-taught developer with a focus on AI integration"
    }
```
